There are three links to tasks on the page:

1. list of messages
    A list of messages is given. A button has been added to each message to delete it.

2. stopwatch
    The "stopwatch" widget has been implemented.
    Buttons "stop", "start" (the same button), "reset", "add". The stopwatch works with millisecond accuracy. When it is running, the time is shown in the format hh:mm:ss:ms. Pressing the "stop" button stops the stopwatch. The "add" button adds the current stopwatch value to the list of results. Elements from the results list can be deleted individually using the "delete" button. The "reset" button stops the stopwatch if it is running, resets the value to zero, and removes all results, if any.
    Keyboard control: s - start/stop, l - add, r - reset.

3. form validation
    Form validation has been implemented.
    validation is applied when the form is submitted. The form cannot be submitted if there are errors. Required fields are marked with asterisks.
    Fields with errors are properly highlighted and the error text is displayed.
